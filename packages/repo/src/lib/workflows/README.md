# Repo Tools Workflows

Workflows consist of a series of tasks that are executed for a specific purpose.
Steps that would normally be performed manually are codified as Tasks which can be composed to form Workflows.
Workflows help to maintain consistency in the repo as it scales, as well allow for patterns to change over time.
