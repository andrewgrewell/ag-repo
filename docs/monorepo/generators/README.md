# Generators
Generators are scripts which will auto generate boilerplate.
Any time you find yourself doing repetitive boilerplate files, you should consider creating a generator.

The two key benefits of generators are:
- Consistency: all project files will follow the same patterns, and if/when those patterns change, it is simple to update the generator and create a codemod script to update all existing files.
- Speed: less time manually creating boilerplate, less time spent fixing mistakes, less context switching
