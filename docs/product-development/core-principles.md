# Core Principles

- Focus on delivering value each iteration.
- Focus on the entire product and don't get tunnel vision.
- Spend the time to define small, achievable goals.
- Perfection is unattainable, but we can always improve **over time**
- Trust automated quality checks to catch most issues, if/when things break, rely on your observability efforts and quickly resolve issues.
- Own your goals, if something is preventing you from achieving your goals, speak up.
- Product development is all about identifying boundaries, without boundaries there is too much ambiguity. Reduce the negative effects of boundaries by defining the inputs and outputs of the boundary.
