# Reactive App Outline

## Introduction
A Reactive app is an application where the core functionality and data layer strictly follows reactive principles.
This means that the data is streams of data that are transformed by operators, and core functionality is contained
in Services which consume and expose observable data.

## Patterns
- Because applications are inherently asynchronous, embrace that fact and do not couple any Service
to its dependencies. In effect this is inversion of control, where the dependencies are injected into the functionality.
But instead of using a traditional DI framework, observables provide all the mechanisms needed to achieve this.

### Anti-patterns
- All dependencies should be exposed on RxServices. It can be tempting to fallback to
providing options to a service, but generally if this is happening you have to ask yourself
if it is something that needs to be provided rather than an inner detail, why is it not an observable?
For example take a PointerService which reads from pointer move events, and exposes those as observable data.
The service also captures pointer button events, which means on browsers it needs to prevent the default behavior of
the "secondary" mouse button. Because of this functionality it's reasonable that the sample rate of mouse events
as well as the disabling of the default browser context menu should be able to be configured.
It's temping to pass in a `throttleTime` and `preventContextMenu` options to the service at creation,
but it's better to expose these as observables that can be configured by the consumer. This way the consumer
can have flexibility on when to configure these values, and they will also be able to be changed at any time.
